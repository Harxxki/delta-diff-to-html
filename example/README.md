# Example Usage

This directory contains examples of how to use the deltabae.sh script in the parent directory.

## Files

- `a.txt`, `b.txt`: Text files to be compared.
- `diff.html` (to be generated): This file will be generated after running the script. It contains the side-by-side diff of `a.txt` and `b.txt` with syntax highlighting.

<!-- TODO: Change to accept arguments -->

## Steps to Run the Example

1. Navigate to the parent directory: `cd ..`
2. Run the deltabae.sh script: `bash deltabae.sh`
3. Open the generated `diff.html` file in a web browser to view the output.

The `diff.html` file should show the differences between `a.txt` and `b.txt` in a side-by-side format with syntax highlighting.
